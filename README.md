# Algèbre II notes

Notes from my algebra II course at the University Paris Cité.

The pdf is available [here](https://yag000.github.io/algebre-II-notes/algebre-II-notes.pdf).

If you suffer from dyslexia you can use this version over [here](https://yag000.github.io/algebre-II-notes/algebre-II-notes-dyslexia.pdf). 
If you still have trouble and you think another font or font size would help, feel free to open an issue, I'll be happy to help.
